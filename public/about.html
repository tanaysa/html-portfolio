<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Tanay Sakaria, a 3rd-year Computer Engineering student at Ramrao Adik Institute of Technology, Navi Mumbai. With a strong foundation in Full Stack Development, Java, and C++, I'm passionate about designing and building scalable software solutions that solve real-world problems.</p>

<p>I actively pursue opportunities that challenge my technical and problem-solving abilities, with a special interest in backend development and systems design. I'm currently working on building a Collaborative Task Management System (like Jira), integrating Spring Boot, MySQL, and core DSA concepts such as Priority Queues, Graphs, and Search & Sorting algorithms, while following Agile/Scrum methodologies.</p>

<p>I'm actively seeking Software Development or Software Engineering roles where I can contribute to impactful projects, learn from experienced mentors, and grow as a developer. I believe in continuous learning, clean code, and collaborative teamwork.</p>
